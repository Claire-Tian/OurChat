# OurChat
Instructions for using ourChat 
Run the Server code (enter python Server.py in the terminal) 
Set the server name to your IP address, then run the client code (run python client.py in the terminal) 
Type in login, and then enter your username and password as “username, password” (username COMMA password). So “Leah,789”, “Claire,123” and “Funing,456” should all work. 
Once logged in, load a chatroom by typing in load. You will be prompted for a chatroom name, enter “Claire Funing”.
After this, you can send a message by typing in “send”
You can add a user by typing in “add_user” and entering the user’s name 
You can delete a user by typing in “delete_user” and entering the user’s name you want to delete
You can view a list of all the chats you are in by typing in “get_my_chats”
Lastly, you can create a chatroom by typing in “create”, then the chatroom name when prompted, and then the users you want to add (delineated by a semicolon). 
For example, “create”, “Claire Leah”, “Claire;Leah” 
Depending on your interpreter, you may need to add quotes around commands/entries to the terminal while using the application. For Leah this was necessary, but for Claire and Funing it was not.
