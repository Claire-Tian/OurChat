# OurChat
Instructions for using ourChat <br />
1. Run the Server code (enter python Server.py in the terminal) <br />
2. Set the server name to your IP address, then run the client code (run python client.py in the terminal) <br />
3. Type in login, and then enter your username and password as “username, password” (username COMMA password). So “Leah,789”, “Claire,123” and “Funing,456” should all work. <br />
4. Once logged in, load a chatroom by typing in load. You will be prompted for a chatroom name, enter “Claire Funing”.<br />
5. After this, you can send a message by typing in “send” <br />
6. You can add a user by typing in “add_user” and entering the user’s name <br />
7. You can delete a user by typing in “delete_user” and entering the user’s name you want to delete <br />
8. You can view a list of all the chats you are in by typing in “get_my_chats” <br />
9. Lastly, you can create a chatroom by typing in “create”, then the chatroom name when prompted, and then the users you want to add (delineated by a semicolon). 
For example, “create”, “Claire Leah”, “Claire;Leah” <br />
Depending on your interpreter, you may need to add quotes around commands/entries to the terminal while using the application. For Leah this was necessary, but for Claire and Funing it was not. <br />
